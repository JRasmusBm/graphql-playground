# Personal Playground to try out GraphQL ideas

Bingelistening to the [https://twitter.com/graphqlradio](@graphqlradio) and
[https://twitter.com/graphqlsummit](@graphqlsummit), I got greatly excited to
try it out myself. This repository is to facilitate experimentation with
various features withing GraphQL, in order to increase my own understanding
with the technology.
