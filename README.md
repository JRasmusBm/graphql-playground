# Personal Playground to try out GraphQL ideas

Bingelistening to the [@graphqlradio](https://twitter.com/graphqlradio) and
[@graphqlsummit](https://twitter.com/graphqlsummit), I got greatly excited to
try it out myself. This repository is to facilitate experimentation with
various features withing GraphQL, in order to increase my own understanding
with the technology.
